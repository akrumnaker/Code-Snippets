Laser Defender

Laser Defender is a Galaga-like game that I created while following a
course on Udemy for Unity3D development. The gameplay is very simple 
(the player attempts to get as high of a score as possible by 
destroying enemies before he/she runs out of lives). I have extended
the game beyond what was entailed in the course, and I have provided 
some code examples from my extensions.
