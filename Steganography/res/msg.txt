The biological principle of DTI is how water diffuses throughout tissues. 
The factors affecting the diffusion are temperature, hydration effect, 
compartmentalization, and obstruction. Diffusion is the transport process 
in which molecules change their position by random thermal collisions.

The physical principle of DTI is that water diffuses in different manners 
between gray matter and white matter. In gray matter, water can diffuse in 
any direction (isotropic diffusion), but in white matter, water can only 
diffuse along the axons (anisotropic diffusion). There is no common 
directionality found in the gray matter which is why is diffuses in any 
direction, and water will follow the path of least resistance in the white 
matter which is why is diffuses along the axons and not between them.

The mathematical principle of DTI streamline tractography is the tracing 
of the principal diffusion directions. There are two thresholds for the 
stop criteria of the trace. The first threshold is the angle between the 
principal directions. For example, if the angle is greater than 70 or 75 
degrees, you would stop for that trace. The second is based on the lowest 
FA value that is accepted.
